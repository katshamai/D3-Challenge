          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>Based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates, there is a direct correlation discovered between health risks and age and income.
            Two key scenarios were mapped: median age of smokers to percentage of smokers in the population; and percentage of population in povety
            to percentage of population who lacks healthcare.
          </p>

          <p>State based outcomes on median age and the percentage of smokers show that smokers in states which has a higher percentage of smokers
            have a median age of 36-44. This is potentially unsurprising as education on the dangers of smoking commenced around the time of this age group
          commencing schooling, and smoking becoming well known as a health hazard. The result in Utah is unusual as the median age of smokers is quite 
          young (30) but it also has the lowest percentage of its population being smokers. This may imply that it is the younger cohort of its population
          who are smokers compared to older citizens.</p>

            <p>In what is an unsurprising outcome, states where there is a higher percentage of population in poverty have a higher percentage of
              the population lacking healthcare. However, Texas appears to be an outlier; while it has a slightly higher than average level of 
              poverty, it has the highest level of its population lacking healthcare.</p>

          <p>State culture and norms may also influence health outcomes but the strength of this influence is unclear.</p>
